# CashPiles

CashPiles is an envelope budgeting program that uses plain text files.  It
allows you to manage all your finances in an easy-to-use file that readably
tracks accounts, income, expenses, budget categories, and more.  The CashPiles
program reads the file, performs calculations, and provides answers and insight.
